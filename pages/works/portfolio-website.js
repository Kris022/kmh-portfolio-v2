            This was my first major project that I have created using a full
            stack framework in form of Next.js. I had done a series of “toy
            programs” before hand, such as a weather app integrating OpenWeather
            API. I’d love to expand on this portfolio in the future, changing up
            the styling, adding more interactive elements to add that
            “wow-effect”, however considering this was my first time building
            full website with next, react and tailwind I am satisfied with how
            it turned out, at least for now.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-5">
            I also worked to make the website responsive. Which is something I
            did not really practise before, but tailwind came in really handy
            with facilitating that process.
